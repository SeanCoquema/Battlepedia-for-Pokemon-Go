# Battlepedia for Pokémon Go

![Battlepedia](https://thumbs.gfycat.com/ConsciousIllinformedJumpingbean-size_restricted.gif)

Battlepedia is a companion app for Pokémon Go with all the data, info and tools needed to win and defend gyms. The app was rejected from Google Play Store for containing copyrighted content(even though loads of other apps on Play Store use Pokémons without any problems), so I'm open sourcing it here on GitHub(because I spent a lot of time on this and I want senpai to notice me.) For now the app is exclusively on Android, and the design is heavily inspired by Google's Material Guidelines.


####Some Screenshots:

####Some of the features of the app are:

  - All 151 Pokémons in Pokémon Go listed.
  - Check the Type Advantage of Pokémons to get "Super Effective" attacks and win your gym battles.
  - Know the move sets of all the Pokémons, including their type and hit value.
  - Calculate Pokémon evolutions' CPs.
  - Get all the hidden stats from the Pokémon Go source code.

What this app **does not** do:
   
  - Tell you where the Pokémons are or where they'll spawn.
  - Help you edit any values or any kind of code.
  - Basically help you cheat in any way at all.
